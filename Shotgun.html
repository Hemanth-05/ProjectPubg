			<b>Base Damage :  <br>
			Magazine Capacity: 14<br>
			Bullet Speed : ?</b>
			<p> A bullpup style shotgun that can hold up to 14 shells of 12 Gauge lethality, it has by far the largest damage potential of any shotgun available in the game, countered by the fact 
			that reloading that many shells will take an obscene amount of time. </p>
			
			<h3 a id = "S12K"><u> S12K: </u></h3>
			<img src = "S12K.jpg">
			
			<b>Base Damage :  195<br>
			Magazine Capacity: 5<br>
			Bullet Speed : 350 m/s</b>
			<p> What the S12K lacks in range, it makes up in sheer volume. The S12K is a devastating weapon at close range while its semi-automatic action makes killing 
			multiple enemies easier than with its pump-action or double-barrel counterparts. The weapon also has an advantage over other shotguns in its reloading time due 
			to being magazine-fed. While its rate of fire allows four shells to be discharged within one second, the extreme recoil means putting multiple consecutive shots 
			into the intended target difficult.</p>
			
			<h3 a id = "S1897"><u> S1897: </u></h3>
			<img src = "S1897.jpg">
			
			<b>Base Damage : 206 <br>
			Magazine Capacity: 5 <br>
			Bullet Speed : 360 m/s</b>
			<p> The S1897 excels in clearing houses with the simple point-and-shoot principle, its spread allowing a greater probability of hitting the target. 
			Careful aim is still essential since missing one shot can easily result in death due to the time required to rack the pump. </p>
			
			<h3 a id = "S686"><u> S686: </u></h3>
			<img src = "S686.jpg">
			
			<b>Base Damage : 216 <br>
			Magazine Capacity: 2<br>
			Bullet Speed : 370 m/s</b>
			<p> The S686 offers unparalleled burst damage in CQB due to its ability to almost instantaneously fire two 12-gauge shells, but it quickly loses damage at range unless 
			equipped with a choke, and has a very long reload time, making dealing with enemies at range or more than one enemy difficult. </p>
