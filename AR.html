			<h2><u><center> AR </center></u></h2>
			<p> Assault Rifles are always a popular pick among Battle Royale shooters and arena shooters such as PUBG Mobile. Due to their mid-range to close-range accuracy, 
			  a decent Rate of Fire, high damage and a great magazine capacity. They're extremely popular among PUBG Mobile players as well. </p>
			  
			  <h3 a id = "AKM"><u> AKM: </u></h3>
			  <img src = "AKM.jpg">
			  
				<b>Base Damage- 49 <br>
				Magazine Capacity: 30</b>
				<p>The AKM is a scary weapon to weild as it high as one of the highest damage counts in the game. A variation on the popular AK-47, the AKM only comes up short in the Recoil department,
				which can be controlled with attachments.</p><br>
			
			
				<h3 a id = "M416"><u> M416: </u></h3>
				<img src = "M416.jpg">
				
				<b>Base Damage: 43 <br>
				Magazine Capacity: 30</b>
				<p>A favourite of both new players and old veterans, the M416 is one of the smartest choices, offering great mid-range damage, the only area the M416 falls short is its ridiculous 
				recoil, but it is manageable with the correct attachments. </p><br>
				
				
				<h3 a id = "SCAR-L"><u> SCAR-L: </u></h3>
				<img src = "SCARL.jpg">
				
				<b>Base Damage: 43 <br>
				Magazine Capacity: 30</b>
				<p>A staple in the shooter genre, the SCAR-L is extremely reliable and only concedes to the M416 in terms of Range but offers way better Recoil control, making it an extremely
				 reliable AR.</p><br>
				 
				 <h3 a id = "M16A4"><u> M16A4: </u></h3>
				 <img src = "M16A4.jpg">
				 
				 <b>Base Damage- 43<br>
				Magazine Capacity- 30</b>
				<p>A classic upgrade on the cold-war era weapon M16, which is a staple of modern shooters. The M16A4 is a powerful AR with great range but the Rate of Fire is
				much slower than other ARs.</p><br>
				
				<h3 a id = "M762"><u> M762: </u></h3>
				 <img src = "M762.jpg">
			
				 <b>Base Damage- 43<br>
				Magazine Capacity- 30</b>
				<P>M762 also called as Beryl is quite powerful, provided you can control the recoil.When you compare the recoil , it will be more than that of AKM.So you should be very good
				with recoil control if you are using this gun.</P>
				
				<h3 a id = "GROZA"><u> GROZA: </u></h3>
				 <img src = "GROZA.jpg">
				 
				 <b>Base Damage- 49<br>
				Magazine Capacity- 30</b>
				<P> GROZA is a rare AR that is available only in Air Drop loot, and is one of the best guns in the game, with the Rate of Fire only second best to M416 but 
				the damage dealt is significantly higher, similar to AKM. </P>
				
				<h3 a id = "AUG A3"><u> AUG A3: </u></h3>
				 <img src = "AUG.jpg">
			
				 <b>Base Damage- 43<br>
				Magazine Capacity- 30</b>
				<P> The AUG A3 is an essential weapon if you like to rush your enemies than picking them off from a distance. It offers great damage from close to mid-range, and 
				is the perfect AR for a rusher playstyle. </P>
				
				<h3 a id = "QBZ"><u> QBZ: </u></h3>
				 <img src = "QBZ.jpg">
			
				 <b>Base Damage- 43<br>

				 <b>Base Damage- 43<br>

				 <b>Base Damage- 49<br>
