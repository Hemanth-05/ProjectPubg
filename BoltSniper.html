			<img src = "AWM.jpg">
			
			<b>Base Damage : 105 <br>
			Magazine Capacity: 5<br>
			Bullet Speed : 945 m/s</b>
			<p> The AWM is a powerful bolt action rifle designed for extreme range sharpshooting. Dealing the highest amount of damage out of any gun in the game, it is also one of
			only two ranged weapons (the other being the crossbow) capable of killing any player in one shot to the head, even if the victim is wearing a Spetsnaz helmet. 
			At distances beyond 500 meters, it becomes the only gun in the game that can kill players in one shot to the head. </p>
			
			<h3 a id = "M24"><u> M24: </u></h3>
			<img src = "M24.jpg">
			
			<b>Base Damage : 79 <br>
			Magazine Capacity: 5<br>
			Bullet Speed : 790 m/s</b>
			<p> The M24 can be seen as another option after the Kar98k, with lower damage but higher muzzle velocity, it has slightly more deviation when not aiming down the sights.
			Being loaded via magazines, tactical reloads will be faster compared to the Kar98k's one-by-one reload, although full reloads with the M24's standard magazine will be
			slightly slower compared to a full reload with the Kar98k. </p>
			
			<h3 a id = "KAR98"><u> KAR98: </u></h3>
			<img src = "KAR98.jpg">
			
			<b>Base Damage : 76 <br>
			Magazine Capacity: 5<br>
			Bullet Speed : 760 m/s</b>
			<p> The Kar98k is highly sought after because of its ability to deal fatal damage against players wearing level 2 helmets, with only level 3 helmets able to protect 
			their wearers from one shot kills assuming they are at more than 85% health. Because of this, it is a very good weapon for long-range engagements without having the 
			risk of going to airdrops for the other bolt-action sniper rifles.  </p>
			
			<h3 a id = "WIN94"><u> WIN94: </u></h3>
			<img src = "WIN94.jpg">
			
			<b>Base Damage : 66 <br>
			Magazine Capacity: 8<br>
			Bullet Speed : 760 m/s</b>
			<p> The Winchester Model 1894 is a starting medium to long range rifle that uses .45 ACP rounds. It is a guaranteed knock down in case of a head shot, when the victim
			does not have a level 2 helmet or higher. The only attachments available for the rifle are sniper rifle bullet loops(allowing for quicker reload speed), making it only
			useful for very early game. </p>
