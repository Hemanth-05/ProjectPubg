			<h3 a id = "UZI"><u> Micro UZI </u></h3>
			<img src = "UZI.jpg">
			
			<b>Base Damage : 26 <br>
			Magazine Capacity: 25<br>
			Bullet Speed : 350 m/s</b>
			<p> The Micro UZI is a submachine gun type weapon in BATTLEGROUNDS. The Micro Uzi has had its stock removed, the magazine shortened, and the barrel reduced to 
			almost pistol length. This results in a more compact, lightweight weapon, with a reduction in accuracy and range. </p>
			
			<h3 a id = "UMP-45"><u> UMP-45 </u></h3>
			<img src = "UMP45.jpg">
			
			<b>Base Damage : 39 <br>
			Magazine Capacity: 25 <br>
			Bullet Speed : 360 m/s</b>
			<p> The UMP45 deals the second highest damage of all the SMGs, right behind the Tommy Gun, making it a very viable late-stage gun when fitted out with attachments.
			Its already small recoil can be reduced even further with a foregrip and compensator,and stealthy players can choose the suppressor instead of using the compensator. </p>
			
			<h3 a id = "VECTOR"><u> Vector </u></h3>
			<img src = "VECTOR.jpg">
			
			<b>Base Damage : 35 <br>
			Magazine Capacity: 19<br>
			Bullet Speed : 350 m/s</b>
			<p> The Vector, with its low recoil and average damage is most useful in close to mid-range combat. Boasting a very high rate of fire and low recoil, this gun also has 
			the benefit of having the most attachment slots of all the SMGs to further increase its performance </p>
			
			<h3 a id = "BIZON"><u> PP-19 Bizon </u></h3>
			<img src = "BIZON.jpeg">
			
			<b>Base Damage : 36 <br>
			Magazine Capacity: 53<br>
			Bullet Speed : 408 m/s</b>
			<p> This weapon is exclusive to Erangel and Vikendi. While in full-auto, its best suited for quick and accurate sparring in close-range. Because of the unique helical magazine
			that runs along the barrel, this SMG doesn't support magazine upgrades or lower rail attachments. However, the weapon has high firing stability built-in, which allows
			for low recoil even without a grip. </p>
			
			<h3 a id = "THOMPSON"><u> Thompson SMG </u></h3>
			<img src = "THOMPSON.jpg">
			
			<b>Base Damage : 39 <br>
			Magazine Capacity: 30<br>
			Bullet Speed : 280 m/s</b>
			<p> Firing the slow but hard-hitting .45 ACP cartridge, this vintage submachine gun deals the most damage out of all the SMGs, however the inability of this gun to 
			attach sights, coupled with its relatively strong recoil makes it a challenge to use, even in close quarters combat. Extended magazines are highly recommended as the
			reload time remains unchanged, while magazine capacity is almost doubled. </p>
			
			<h3 a id = "MP5K"><u> MP5K </u></h3>
			<img src = "MP5K.jpg">
			
			<b>Base Damage : 33 <br>
			Magazine Capacity: 30<br> 
			Bullet Speed : 400 m/s</b>
			<p> The MP5K is a sub-machine gun chambered for 9mm ammunition. While the firing mechanics of the MP5K are similar to those of the Vector, it boasts a higher per bullet 
			damage, but with a lower overall firing rate and DPS [1]. </p>
			
			<h3 a id = "P90"><u> P90 </u></h3>
			<img src = "P90.jpg">
			
			<b>Base Damage : 30 <br>
			Magazine Capacity: 50<br>
			Bullet Speed :</b>
			<p> This gun is only avaliable in arena and not in classic matches.This gun has a high stablity even without any equpments and has a magzine of 50. </p>
