			<h2><u><center> Pistols </center></u></h2>
			
			<h3 a id = "P18C"><u> P18C: </u></h3>
			<img src = "P18C.jpg">
			
			<b>Base Damage : 23 <br>
			Magazine Capacity: 17<br>
			Bullet Speed : 375 m/s</b>
			<p> The P18C is a automatic secondary and because of this it's the lowest damaging pistol in the game. Despite this, it actually boasts the highest damage per second 
			of all the pistols, even rivaling submachine guns in terms of utility. </p>
			
			<h3 a id = "P92"><u> P92: </u></h3>
			<img src = "P92.jpg">
			
			<b>Base Damage : 35 <br>
			Magazine Capacity: 15<br>
			Bullet Speed : 280 m/s</b>
			<p> The P92 is the middle ground of the pistols, with a balance of firepower and ammo capacity. With a modest rate of fire and steady hands, this pistol can quickly determine 
			the winner in early game fights while everyone is rushing to find guns. </p>
			
			<h3 a id = "P1911"><u> P1911: </u></h3>
			<img src = "P1911.jpg">
			
			<b>Base Damage : 39 <br>
			Magazine Capacity: 7<br>
			Bullet Speed : 250 m/s</b>
			<p> The P1911 packs a punch in a small package. Its damage output is limited only by the small magazine size and the skill of its operator. </p>
			
			<h3 a id = "R45"><u> R45: </u></h3>
			<img src = "R45.png">
			
			<b>Base Damage : 53 <br>
			Magazine Capacity: 6<br>
			Bullet Speed : 330 m/s</b>
			<p> A powerful revolver that can be seen as Miramar's version of the R1895, it has one less round than the R1895, but reloads with a speedloader instead of loading 
			individual rounds, greatly reducing reload time. </p>
			
			<h3 a id = " DesertEagle"><u>  Desert Eagle </u></h3>
			<img src = " DESERT.jpeg">
			
			<b>Base Damage : 62 <br>
			Magazine Capacity: 7<br>
			Bullet Speed : 450 m/s</b>
			<p> The Deagle (Also known as desert eagle) is a high damage up-close-and-personal weapon, but with the Laser Sight attached it can have a boost to its hipfire accuracy. </p>
			
			<h3 a id = "Skorpion"><u> Skorpion </u></h3>
			<img src = "SKORPIAN.jpg">
			
			<b>Base Damage : 26 <br>
			Magazine Capacity: 20<br>
			Bullet Speed : 350 m/s</b>
			<p> A full-sized machine pistol that occupies the sidearm slot, the Skorpion is very controllable for such a weapon, even when fired in full auto. With a 20 round 
			magazine as standard and capable of being increased to 40, it can serve as a dependable pocket SMG to free up the other weapon slots for more powerful guns. </p>
			
			<h3 a id = "R1895"><u> R1895: </u></h3>
			<img src = "R1895.jpg">
			
			<b>Base Damage : 55 <br>
			Magazine Capacity: 7<br>
			Bullet Speed : 330 m/s</b>
			<p> The R1895 is one of the most challenging weapons to use, in that it has severe drawbacks that usually negate its benefits.  </p>
			
			<h3 a id = "SAWED"><u> Sawed-Off </u></h3>
			<img src = "SAWEDOFF.jpg">
			
			<b>Base Damage : 160 <br>
			Magazine Capacity: 2<br>
			Bullet Speed : 330 m/s</b>
			<p> The smallest shotgun available in the game, the Sawed-off functions like a pocket S686, albeit with higher spread due to the short barrel. It has two barrels, 
			side-by-side, and as such can hold two rounds. Like the S686, it can quickly fire off both barrels to quickly do a lot of damage. </p>
